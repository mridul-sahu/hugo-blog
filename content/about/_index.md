# About Me
{{< img-post "/img/main" "author.jpg" "Alt Text" "right" >}}
I'm [Mridul Sahu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mridul-sahu/) *(yes that person with odd combination of clothings on the right)*. I currenty live in Mumbai, India with my roomates and a laptop. I graduated in 2018 majoring in Computer Scince and Engineering and worked on many projects personal and otherwise, honing my skills to the point where I decided to share it with the world and enable others to join the facinating world of computers.  

I try to be involved with the current trends in the tech world but i can't ever seem to catch up with it. At the moment I am trying to wrap my head around the amazing things people are doing, revolutionizing [music](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/) and [gaming](https://stadia.dev/blog/) being some of my favourites. I hope this blog will be a part of my journey, building amazing stuff like these.

# Why blog?
To share what I learn with others but also I needed a way to keep track of things I learn over time or am working on. I read about stuff I find interesting, then document them with a blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.
