# About Me
{{< img-post "/img/main" "author.jpg" "Alt Text" "right" >}}
I'm {{< url-link "Mridul Sahu" "https://www.linkedin.com/in/mridul-sahu/">}} *(yes that person on the right with odd combination of clothings)*. I currently live in Mumbai, India with my roommates and my laptop. I graduated in 2018 with Computer Science and Engineering Majors, and have worked on many projects personal and otherwise, honing my skills to the point where I decided to share it with the world hoping to enable others to be a part of the fascinating and amazing world of computers.

I try to be involved with the current trends in technology as much as I can but can't ever seem to catch up with it. At the moment of this writing, I am trying to wrap my head around the amazing things people are doing everyday, revolutionising {{< url-link "music" "https://magenta.tensorflow.org/">}} and {{< url-link "gaming" "https://stadia.dev/blog/">}} being some of my favourites. I hope this blog will be a part of my journey towards building amazing stuff like these.

# Why blog?
Mainly to share what I learn with others, but also I needed a way to keep track of things I learn over time or am working on. I read about stuff I find interesting, then document them with a blog post, which I can easily find and refer to later. Hopefully other people will find these posts helpful, relevant, or interesting.:v:
